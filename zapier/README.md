# AgentQL Zapier Integration

This Zapier integration project is generated by the `zapier init` CLI command.

These are what you normally do next:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
zapier test

# Register the integration on Zapier if you haven't
zapier register "App Title"

# Or you can link to an existing integration on Zapier
zapier link

# Push it to Zapier
zapier push
```

## Test

**Note:**
This test only applies when the integration is private. I'm not sure how do we pin a version for public while being able to push to the integration.

1. Do `zapier push`
2. Create a test Zaps
3. Add a trigger (E.g. When receiving a new email in gmail in box)
4. Add a step and search "AgentQL Official"
5. Follow the steps to setup the api key and test on the actions
