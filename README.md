# AgentQL Integrations

[AgentQL](https://agentql.com) provides structured data extraction from web pages using an AgentQL query or a Natural Language prompt and can interact with web pages using Playwright. AgentQL can be used across multiple languages and web pages without breaking over time and change, making it the perfect tool for automations and AI agents. [Check out all our integrations](https://docs.agentql.com/integrations) or [get started with our SDK or API](https://docs.agentql.com/quick-start).

## What is AgentQL useful for?

- Finding elements on a page without knowing their selectors
- Getting all the line items on a spreadsheet
- Scraping data from a jobs site
- Automating form submissions
- Opening hundreds of links then getting prices from every page
